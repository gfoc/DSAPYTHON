//Bubble Sort Using Python 
//Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list of elements, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
//This process continues until the entire list is sorted

def sort(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)-1,0,-1): // iterating from last index to first in reverse direction 
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[j] > nums[j+1]: // condition to perform swapping 
                temp = nums[j]
                nums[j] = nums[j+1]
                nums[j+1] = temp

nums = [5,2,7,8,1,4,3,9,6]
sort(nums)
print(nums)
